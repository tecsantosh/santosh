Hi, I am a PhD candidate at the [Charles and Louise Travers department of Political Science](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/), and a Research Associate at the [Center for the Politics of Development](http://cpd.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. Welcome to my website!

My broad research interests lie in comparative politics and the political economy of development. My current projects centre on the links between norms and political behaviour, with applications to gender and religious conservatism.

### Teaching
#### UC Berkeley
I have been a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for PS 3, an introductory class in quantitative and empirical methods. [Professor Laura Stoker](http://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/laura-stoker) was the lead instructor, and I received an award for being an [Outstanding GSI](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/). 

Some of my teaching materials for the class are available here (coming soon!). Some in-class exercises draw heavily on those created by [Sara Newland](https://scholar.harvard.edu/snewland) (thanks, Sara!).

#### Georgetown University
I was a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Regression/Program Analysis Methods at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy in 2014. The class was taught by [Professor Jean Mitchell](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/faculty-profile?netid=mitchejm%2F) and is the final course of the compulsory quantitative sequence for graduate students in the school's Master of Public Policy program.
